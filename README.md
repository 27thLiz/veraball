**A "roll the ball" game.** Collect coins, then reach the goal as fast as
possible, without falling out of the level.

You can earn boost by rolling; the faster you roll, the more boost you will gain.

## Installation

This game uses the [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org), a free/libre 2D and
3D game engine. You can import this folder (once downloaded or cloned) using the

current stable release) will not work.**
